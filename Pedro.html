				Pedro had his first contact with programming during his first semester at the University 
				while pursuing his Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering. After his first year, he obtained a teaching 
				assistantship to help other students who were learning how to program for the first time.
				After completing the teaching assistantship, he spent a year working in the Laboratory of Computational Methods in 
				Engineering - a lab in the university that had, as it's main purpose, the creation of software to solve engineering problems.
